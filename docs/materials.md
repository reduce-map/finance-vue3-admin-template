## Project Mind Outcome

- “If a stone flying through the air were conscious, it would think it was flying by its own will,” relies on Spinoza, [original link](https://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/Spinoza/let6258.htm)

- "It is evident from statistics that resource management is far more important than the resources themselves."
